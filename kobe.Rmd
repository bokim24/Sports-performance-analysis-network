as per NBA.com advanced stats page, "Advanced Box Score Stats only go back to the 1996-97 Season"

What a time... To be alive... xD

This means that though I will not be looking at Michael Jordan's career, we still get juicy content with the
likes of Allen Iverson, Ray Allen, Jermaine O'Neal, Steve Nash, Peja StojakoviÄ‡, and even Stephon Marbury,
a talent loaded, high flyin, sharp shooting, 1996 draft class. 

Oh, and did I mention Kobe Bryant? Here's me quoting wiki again, "Bill Branch, the Hornets' head scout at the time, said that the Hornets agreed to trade their draft selection at #13 to the Lakers the day before the draft. Prior to the trade agreement, the Hornets never considered drafting Bryant. During the draft, the Lakers told the Hornets whom to select minutes before the pick was made.[31] Bryant was the first guard ever drafted directly out of high school"

Just wow. Not only was this man passed up by 13 other teams, he probably wasn't even considered a lottery talent by the other twelve teams that drafted before the Charlotte draft pick... Whatever the case, The Lakers had just acquired a Hall of Famer 
who would soon lead them to five BIG BIG rings. What a time... To be alive...

## Apparently Kobe's Player ID is 977. I cheated by going to his stats page on NBA.com 
## since he's not a current active player, he will not be on the current active player list obvi.

## So I have to warn those who read my code to formulate their own because we may be doing similar
## processes for various desired results. So anyway, this for loop below that You'll see many times
## in my code is what generates the NBA.com advanced gamelogs JSON files. However, for one reason or another
## this combination of fromJSON(paste0(readlines(json url))) likes to go into timeout every once in awhile...
## I haven't figured out why it does this.. I was using seq_along(getyrs) for iteration of i, but I changed that
## 1 in 1:20 for this reason: I thought that the seq_along was causing my code to run in an infinite loop aka 
## causing error and timeout, but that wasn't it. sometimes it doesn't even work when I try to pass a single url 
## to this process, which is what really irks me (might just have to do with the way that the ports are set up, or
## maybe it's something to do with permissions idk). Usually, when I clear environment and restart R, and rerun the
## whole script from the top (aka the libraries) everything runs smoothly.

## Everything unlisted (sortable), and nicely iterated, but first we'll find the process it takes to make the full career gamelog

## (first name in caps)(season number*last season first) <- i.e. TOBY10, KOBE5 
##   -> these are the gamelogs of the teams that said player played on.
##      if we have a case like Tobias where he has multiple dataframes for
##      a single season, we cut and rbind (refer to toby code) where appropriate.
##      otherwise, we make (player_initials)gamelog(season) by merging. 





## 2015-16 szn <-- last season first** Kobe's last active season is the 15-16 season.
## Since we have 20 dataframes to merge and match, maybe it's best for us to make a loop/function...

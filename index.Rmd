I believe that graphs can change the way we look at sports and player data.

My goal here, at SPAN, is for you - the reader/audience - to play around with some graphs and learn a few things on your own. Maybe you'll find patterns and flows in a player's career: does a player's chart seem more 'amplified' than another's? does it seem more aligator-toothed or zigzag-shaped than another's? Or maybe you saw that a large portion of a player's chart is missing, while another's is disconnected seemingly everywhere you look. 

Tables are just so inefficient. Your eyes - and mind for that matter - can't possibly hope to extract any intangible information just by looking at tables of numbers. I'm not saying it's impossible, or even that tables are 'bad': sites like basketballmonster, or the basketball-, pro-football-, baseball-references, or even NBA.com, may all have certain qualities about them that make them unique in their own way. Basketballmonster shows you all the ranks that you might want for your fantasy season, the references and sites like NBA.com may show you details about a player's splits or advanced stats for example, but either way, you're still looking at tables and tables and tables....

If WE as fantasy GMs want to "invest" in certain players, it's time we took the next step
and actually try to dive into the data ourselves with some real data visualization. 


Thanks and enjoy ~

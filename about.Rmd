Hey!

Thanks for visiting my page; I know it's pretty lame right now at the moment, but hopefully I can make it better along the way. 

I also want to do a youtube page, but I haven't figured out what I want to focus my discussion around. We'll get to that soon. 

For now, please enjoy some of the players that I have scripts for. 

Hopefully, R doesn't crash on me as I add more players on, and what's even scarier is that hopefully, NBA.com doesn't block me out and deny permission to scrape...

If you have any questions/thoughts/comments

uhhhhh send me an email i guess. lol.
